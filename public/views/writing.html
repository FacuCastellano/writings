                Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
                Sometimes I feel like my only friend
                Is the city I live in, the city of angels
                Lonely as I am, together we cry
                I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
                I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
                She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
                Well, I never worry, now that is a lie
                I don't ever wanna feel
                Like I did that day
                Take me to the place I love
                Take me all the way
                I don't ever wanna feel
                Like I did that day
                Take me to the place I love
                Take me all the way
                Yeah, yeah, yeah
                It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
                It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
                At least I have her love, the city, she loves me
                Lonely as I am, together we cry
                I don't ever wanna feel
                Like I did that day
                Take me to the place I love
                Take me all the way
                I don't ever wanna feel
                Like I did that day
                Take me to the place I love
                Take me all the way
                Yeah, yeah, yeah
                Oh, no, no-no, yeah, yeah
                Love me, I say, yeah yeah
                One time
                Is where I drew some blood
                (Under the bridge downtown)
                I could not get enough
                (Under the bridge downtown)
                Forgot about my love
                (Under the bridge downtown)
                I gave my life away
                Yeah, yeah
                Oh, no, no-no-no, yeah, yeah
                Oh, no, I said, oh, yeah, yeah
                Where I stay
